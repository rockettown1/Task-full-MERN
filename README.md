## MERN stack weekend project.

I found myself with some free time over the weekend and this was the result.

- MongoDB (Atlas hosted on AWS)
- Express (Rest API handling routes, auth and sessions)
- React (using hooks, client-side routing (private routes), Context API (global state) and Styled Components)
- Node (middleware, models and server setup)

All styling is 100% custom.
